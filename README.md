**Ash** is a suckless experimental shell, inspired by fish and my waifu. So `A` stands for Annie.

## About the Project

Ash is an experimental shell designed with the following principles:
1. **Non-scriptable**: I prefer writing Perl to automate things, rather than bash.
2. **Suckless**: No outer state that affects the view and how the shell works.
3. **Simple**: It should stay simple and small.
